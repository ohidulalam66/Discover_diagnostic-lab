    "description": "Haematology involves the diagnosis and treatment of patients who have disorders of the blood and bone marrow. Whilst a major part of a haematologistâ€™s time is spent in providing direct clinical care to patients, diagnostic work in the laboratory is also a significant part of their work.Haematology is the specialty responsible for the diagnosis and management of a wide range of benign and malignant disorders of the red and white blood cells, platelets and the coagulation system in adults and children.Haematologists care directly for patients on hospital wards and out patient clinics. Their patients may have a serious life- threatening illness such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma that requires chemotherapy. They also advise GPs about how to care for patients in their homes. Some haematologists specialise in diseases affecting the blood coagulation system such as haemophilia, while others  provide expertise in the areas of blood transfusion or disorders of haemoglobin such as sickle cell disease.Haematologists work very closely with other health professionals including GPs, pharmacists and specialist nurses, advising colleagues in hospital and primary care.For example, haematologists are the pathologists who receive blood samples from GP surgeries and check them for abnormalities. They look at blood film and, for example, if they suspect leukaemia, can assess the patient, explain concerns, perform a bone marrow biopsy and examine and interpret the samples. The diagnosis can be done within a few hours, since in some cases treatment must be started immediately."
